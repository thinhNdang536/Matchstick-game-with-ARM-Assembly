# Matchstick Game with ARM Assembly

A small yet fun assessment project where a simple matchstick game is implemented using ARM Assembly. The project demonstrates the use of assembly language in developing interactive games and implementing game logic.

## 🏆 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Matchstick Game** where two players take turns to pick matchsticks from a pile. The player who is forced to take the last matchstick loses the game.

### Game Rules:
- The game starts with a certain number of matchsticks (e.g., 21).
- Players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 matchsticks from the pile.
- The player who is left with the last matchstick loses the game.

The game is implemented using ARM Assembly to show how low-level programming can be used to create interactive applications. It's a great way to understand the fundamentals of assembly language and how games can be developed using it.

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates the use of ARM Assembly to create a simple interactive matchstick game. The program is designed to simulate a two-player matchstick game, with one player being the user and the other being the computer. The computer AI is programmed to follow basic rules to make the game playable.

### Features:
- **Two-player game mode**: Player vs. AI or Player vs. Player.
- **Game logic**: AI follows basic strategy to play optimally.
- **Terminal-based**: Text-based interface to interact with the game in the terminal.

## 🔧 Installation

To run and test the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install ARMlite
Since this project is built using **ARM Assembly**, you'll need to use **ARMlite**, an online ARM Assembly simulator that allows you to write and run ARM assembly code without needing a physical ARM processor or emulator.

- Visit [ARMlite](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/ARMlite/) and use the online simulator to run the project.
- No installation is needed since it's an online tool, just open the link and paste your ARM assembly code.

### 2. Running the Code:
Once you open the **ARMlite** website, paste the assembly code into the provided editor and hit **Run**. The simulator will execute your code, and you can interact with the game in the terminal-based environment.
